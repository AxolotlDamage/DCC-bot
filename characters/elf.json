Detecting the answer to a specific question within the scope of the thoughts described below generally takes 1d4 rounds once the appropriate round of concentration is reached. For example, finding out where an evil necromancer hid his magic ring takes 1d4 rounds after the 4th round of concentration (recent memories), and understanding why the necromancer bears an irrational hatred toward the king takes 1d4 rounds after the 6th round of concentration (subconscious motivations).",

The caster can then continue to narrow the categories with subsequent rounds of concentration; each time he is aware of how many creatures remain part of the \u201cmurmur\u201d and what general category of creature to which they belong.

It is aware of this attempt and perceives that someone is trying to read its thoughts.

The material cost is 1,000 gp per caster level, plus any unusual materials (e.g., an adamantine staff requires sufficient adamantine), plus a minimum of 2 points of spellburn per caster level to properly bond the staff. One point of this spellburn never heals; it is permanent ability loss. Additionally, the caster must have the requisite spells that will be placed into the staff, and be able to utilize them without rest during the casting period. The casting period is ongoing with brief spurts of restless sleep, and the caster does not heal spellburn (or other wounds) during this time. The staff\u2019s efficacy is much greater at higher caster levels, and thus the time and material cost rises as the wizard progresses in power level. In the descriptions below, \u201coriginal caster level\u201d refers to the level at which the wizard crafted the staff \u2013 if he advances in level after creating the staff, abilities associated with original caster level do not increase."

The caster\u2019s thoughts and the spirit\u2019s thoughts blur; he can access its memories and opinions; and it can do the same. For a period of 7 days, the caster is in constant contact with the spirit and occasionally loses track of his own self. While the spirit cannot control the caster\u2019s mortal form, its personality may occasionally break through in the caster\u2019s pattern of speech or body language. Great and powerful spirits may have profound knowledge beyond the caster\u2019s understanding (i.e., the memories of a god or the long-range intrigues of a demon prince), but to the extent that the caster\u2019s intelligence and mortal mind can understand the thoughts of the spirit in question, he can form an almost perfect link. The caster\u2019s questions are quickly and accurately answered by the spirit, and the caster can surrender his free will to allow the spirit\u2019s mind to guide his actions. Generally speaking, this is sufficient to confer a +4 bonus to activities based on the spirit\u2019s knowledge and expertise. For example, if the caster contacts the creator of a spell, then surrenders his free will to cast the spell, he would receive a +4 bonus to that spell check; or, if the caster contacts his patron and casts a patron spell, he would receive a +4 bonus to the spell check. However, each time the caster allows the spirit this level of control, there is a 1% chance it takes over the caster\u2019s body completely."

The caster must first obtain the proper material components to create extracts; at least 1 venom extract is required to make a poison. Then, the caster picks a poison from the Poison Brewing List (below) to obtain the base DC. The base DC is further modified by the Poison Delivery Method table. Additional materials needed to complete the process cost half the target DC (rounded down) x10 gp. Once the target DC is calculated, the caster makes the spell check against that number. Unlike most spell checks, when creating poison the caster makes a spell check against a target DC. A spell check that would reflect successful casting (14+) but fails to meet the target DC consumes the extract components, but does not create a viable poison. Each successfully created poison grants one use of the poison attack. Poison effects are detailed in Appendix P: Poisons in the core rulebook. However, the judge shouldn\u2019t feel limited to these poisons. The venom sac of any creature with a poison attack can be used to make extracts. The base DC for brewing purposes is equivalent to the attack\u2019s saving throw DC +5. Giant creatures add +4 to the target DC, and demonic creatures add +8. Both yield 3 extracts per creature.",
