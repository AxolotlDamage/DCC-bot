Torches go out, lanterns sputter and die, glowworms fade, and so on. However, the cleric can see through the darkness. The dark space can be moved up to 100\u2019 per round without concentration. It lasts for up to 1 day or until dismissed.",
                    "32+": "The cleric can blot out the sun, the moon, the stars, or other sources of light. This extraordinary display of divine power requires great concentration. If this result is achieved, the cleric may continue to concentrate. All light sources that illuminate a space 500\u2019 in all directions begin to fade. For every round the cleric concentrates, light sources fade by 1d20%. Torches still burn, but their flames seem to emit less light each round. The judge rolls each round the cleric continues to concentrate. When the total breaks 100%, all light sources have been completely extinguished, and the countryside around the cleric is completely darkened (at least to the eyes of all within 500\u2019 \u2013 the sun still seems to shine in other kingdoms). Once all light sources are extinguished, the radius of the effect begins to expand by another 1d20\u2019 per round of concentration. The maximum range is the cleric\u2019s CL x 1,000\u2019. The effect continues as long as the cleric concentrates. When concentration is broken, the light reappears at the same rate it was extinguished; e.g., if it took 7 rounds to fade, it takes 7 rounds to reach full strength again."
