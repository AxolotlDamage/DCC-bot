    "3": "Soul dedication. In order to cast the spell, the wizard must either dedicate the soul of the target to his patron or the soul of a creature with hit dice equal to that of the target. If the caster fails to claim the soul for his patron, the spell cannot be recast until the patron is appeased.",
    "4": "Health bane. Casting this spell always temporarily reduces the wizard’s Stamina by 1d3 points. This ability loss is in addition to any spellburn and is deducted before spellburn occurs.",
    "5": "Difficult to cast. Instead of rolling as normal on a spell check, the wizard rolls a reduced die (based on the dice chain; i.e., d20 becomes d16).",

For every two digits lost, he suffers a permanent -1 penalty to Agility. The digits can be replaced by magic, but if the wizard ever runs out of them, he cannot cast this spell.",
    "9": "Anima drain. The wizard suffers corruption every time he casts the spell, regardless of spell check, unless he spellburns.",
    "10": "Blood magic. The power of this spell is partially drawn from spilled blood, a sacrifice to the unknowable lords of Magic. A living creature with hit points equal to or greater than the spell’s level must be offered up before the spell is cast; otherwise, the spell check suffers a -4 penalty or patron taint (judge’s choice). The creature need not be sentient; chickens, goats, and other simple animals with the proper amount of hit points will suffice.",
    "11": "Planar rift. Casting the spell tears jagged hole in the warp and weft of the multiverse. There is a cumulative 1% chance that a horror from the outer dark steps through the rift. The fearsome creature has HD equal to the caster’s level + 5. Roll 1d3: (1) the monster steals the spell from the PC’s mind before vanishing forever; (2) the monster attacks the PC with the intent to slay the caster; (3) the monster seeks to strike a bargain with the caster, offering the PC forbidden knowledge (judge’s choice) in exchange for the souls of the caster’s party.",

    "14": "Sleep of ages. After casting this spell, the wizard must make a Fort save (DC 5 + the spell’s level) or fall into a deep sleep for 1 day for each level of the spell. He cannot be awakened by any mundane or magical means during this time.",
    "15": "Material magic. The spell requires the caster to possess an uncommon substance or item to power its magic, beyond the normal components. This material component is determined by the judge and its rarity should be indicative of the spell’s power. The object or item is consumed by a successful casting.",
    "16": "Primordial channel. Memories from before the time of Man flood the caster’s mind as he takes on a primitive demeanor. Every time he casts this spell, the wizard devolves to sub-human tendencies for 1d4 rounds thereafter. During this time, he cannot speak intelligently, cannot cast other spells, cannot use complex devices, cannot read or write, etc.",
    "17": "Stolen knowledge. The formula for the spell was stolen from a powerful extraplanar being. Each time the spell is cast there is a 1% chance per spell level that the being emerges to take back its occult knowledge… the hard way. Roll 1d7: (1) Grand Sultan of the Efreet; (2) the great Cthulhu; (3) a Grand Prince of Hell; (4) an elephant-faced godling of the Outer Dark; (5) the spirit of a long dead archmage; (6) a mechanized brain from the distant future; (7) an elemental prince.",
    "18": "Vermin attractor. The spell attracts a swarm of bothersome insects to the caster’s location that arrive 1d4 rounds after the spell is completed.

    "19": "Siphon magic. Casting this spell has a 50% chance of causing the caster or another nearby person to forget a spell of equal level for the day as if they had failed a spell check. If it is determined that a spell caster loses a spell, there is a 3 in 4 chance it is the wizard himself and a 1 in 4 chance it affects the next closest spell caster. If the affected spell caster does not have a spell of the appropriate level, he takes damage equal 1d6 + the spell’s level.",

  "23": "Elemental surge. The spell is accompanied by a surge of elemental energy. Roll 1d4: (1) fire; (2) water; (3) earth; (4) air. The caster and all within 10’ take 1d6 damage of the appropriate type.",
  "24": "Temporal distortion. Time warps around the caster. For 1d4 rounds, all creatures within 20’ act as if under the effects of a slow spell.",

  "39": "Mystic barrier. A magical barrier appears around the caster for 1d4 rounds, granting +4 AC.",
  "40": "Reality fracture. The spell causes a minor fracture in reality, resulting in unpredictable effects. Roll 1d6: (1) harmless; (2) minor corruption; (3) major corruption; (4) random teleportation; (5) time distortion; (6) planar shift.",
    "41-60": "No change. The spell manifests as standard.",
  "61": "Loud enough for you? Due to the ineffable demands of magic, this spell must be shouted when cast, effectively negating any chance of the caster remaining undetected before the casting is completed.",
  "62": "Gender bender. Casting the spell causes the wizard to temporarily transform into the opposite gender. This sex change remains in effect for one hour per level of the spell. Recasting the spell shifts the caster back into his original sex, but a failure on the spell check causes the wizard to remain as the shifted gender until a full 24 hours have passed.",
  "63": "Diurnal/nocturnal magic. The spell’s power is tied to either night or day. During the ascendant period, the wizard rolls 1d24 for spell checks; during the descendent hours he rolls 1d16. If the wizard’s spell check does not use a 1d20, roll an appropriately higher and lower die according to the dice chain.",
  "64": "Wealful/woeful magic. Each time this spell is cast, there is a random 10%-60% chance that the wizard’s Luck score is altered by its magic. If the wizard’s Luck is affected, it is either raised 1d3 points (50% chance) or lowered 1d3 points (50% chance).",
  "65": "Casting circle. The spell’s power can be amplified with the assistance of other wizards. For each wizard present and willing to assist the caster, the casting wizard gets a +1 modifier to his spell check. Assisting in spell casting does not require knowledge of the spell, but the assistant mages can perform no other action until the spell is cast.",
  "66": "Accidental alchemist. Each time the spell is cast, one random item within 20 feet of the caster is turned to lead and another is turned to gold. Both objects probably weigh more than they previously did, and the gold object is worth twice its normal cost or 1gp, whichever is more.",
  "67": "St. Gygakk’s fire. Casting this spell results in the wizard being limned by flickering chartreuse fire for 1d4 rounds, granting opponents a +2 bonus to attacks against the caster. It also negates any concealment and invisibility enjoyed by the caster, but does provide a faint illumination to the area immediately surrounding the wizard.",
  "68": "Mirror magic. This spell causes an eldritch echo that duplicates the wizard’s appearance as if he had cast a mirror image spell with a spell check of 16-19. However, each duplicate image created saps the caster of a single point of Personality until the image is dispersed.",
  "69": "Skeletal caster. The wizard’s skin and internal organs become transparent for 1d4 rounds after casting this spell, making him appear as a clothed skeleton. Although likely to be mistaken as an un-dead, the wizard also enjoys a +2 bonus to his AC against missile attacks.",
  "70": "Temporal echo. Each time the wizard casts this spell, he predicts the numerical result of his spell check roll. If he rolls this number exactly, the spell automatically re-casts itself each round for 1d3 rounds. The predicted result must be a successful spell check; predicting a failed result has no effect.",
  "71": "Worms of the earth. Pale white worms crawl forth from the earth whenever the wizard casts this spell, writhing in fiery agony (or unholy delight) before expiring on the open ground. Easily crushed underfoot, the worms disintegrate into greasy ash after 1d6 rounds.",
  "72": "Chain casting. Each successive casting of the spell grants a +1 bonus to wizard’s spell check, up to a total bonus equal to the caster’s Int or Luck modifier (whichever is higher). If the wizard casts another spell, he breaks the chain, resetting the modifier back to +0.",
  "73": "Karmic casting. Before making the spell check, the wizard can choose to add or subtract 1d5 from the roll. If the caster adds 1d5, the next time he casts the spell he must subtract 1d5, and vice versa. After two castings, the karma is reset, and the wizard again gets to choose what modifier to use, if any.",
  "74": "Tide of ash. All living vegetative matter within 10’ per spell level is reduced to ash. Vegetative creatures caught within this radius take 1d14 points of damage per spell level. Dead vegetative matter is unaffected.",
  "75": "Spell by proxy. The wizard can choose another person or object to deliver this spell in his stead. He must first touch the proxy and then cast the spell, which does not take effect at that time. The proxy releases the spell a number of rounds later equal to 1d4+the spell’s level. Non-intelligent proxies automatically release the spell at this time; intelligent proxies can release it at will at any point prior to the time indicated.",
  "76": "Silenced. At his discretion, the wizard is able to cast the spell silently. He need not speak, and any auditory effects of the spell can be suppressed.",
  "77": "Call of the Outer Dark. Strange chimes scream in the air and foreign stars waver above the wizard. All looking at the caster must make DC 10 Will saves or be entranced for 1d3 rounds. Attacking entranced characters instantly frees them from their enchantment.",
  "78": "Mentalism. The wizard can cast the spell using ESP alone. He need not move, speak, breathe, or use any material ingredients to invoke the effects.",
  "79": "Plague of rats. Thousands of rats, mice, moles and voles pour from the caster’s sleeves, robes and pockets, scattering in every direction. Physical attacks against the caster are softened by 1d4 points of damage, the blow cushioned by the squealing tide of rodents.",
  "80": "Dimensional schism. By casting the spell, the wizard hurls himself into the warp of multiple realities. 1d7+1 duplicates of the caster appear, identical in nearly every respect, but each drawn from its own parallel universe. Attacks against the caster are randomly assigned across the doppelgangers. The doppelgangers remain for 1 round per spell level. There is a 1% chance per spell level that the original caster vanishes into one of the alternate realities, replaced by a nearly identical incarnation of opposite alignment and patron.",
  "81": "Terrible to behold. The wizard becomes fearsome when casting the spell. Roll 1d6: (1) he appears to grow in size; (2) he takes on a horrid expression; (3) he glows a fiery red; (4) his body is shadowed while his face is brightly lit; (5) the aspect of his patron towers above him; (6) the wind whirls around him.",
  "82": "Spell killer. Casting the spell steals energy from a dying world, and any use of the spell causes the death of untold thousands. Every night following a casting of the spell, the wizard is haunted by dream-communications from an ancient sorcerer-king desperate to save his people.",
  "83": "Blue star. A blue, seven-pointed star flares brightly on the wizard’s forehead each time the spell is cast. The star casts a circle of glaring light 25’ in diameter per spell level.",
  "84": "Energy burst. When successfully casting this spell, the wizard is surrounded by a burst of energy. Roll 1d6: (1) wreathes of flame, which do not affect the wizard but ignite flammable objects within 5’ and cause 1d6 damage to melee opponents; (2) crackles of electricity, which arc to the nearest enemy within 10’ and cause 1d6 damage; (3) aura of frost, which causes 1d4 cold damage to everything within 10’ and automatically snuff torches and lanterns in range; (4) cloud of ash, which the wizard can see through but obscures the sight of all others within 5’; (5-6) instead of determining effect at time of spell acquisition, roll 1d4 each time the spell is cast and compare to above results.",
  "85": "Psychic shield. In the round immediately following the casting of this spell, the wizard gains a +2 bonus to his AC and any Will saves, as he is encased in a protective barrier of psychic energy. It disperses the following round.",
  "86": "Mystic twin. Casting the spell causes a fully functioning twin face to appear in the caster’s chest. The face remains for 1d3 rounds. During that time, this dual face has its own 1d20 action die under the control of the player, with which it can speak, cast spells as the caster, or spout cryptic wisdom.",
  "87": "Planar blink. After casting the spell, the caster unpredictably blinks in and out of this plane of existence, granting a +4 bonus to the wizard’s AC at cost of a -4 penalty to all the wizard’s attacks. The effect lasts for 1 round per spell level. There is a 1% chance per spell level that the wizard does not return from his involuntary jaunt across the cosmos.",
  "88": "Rain of frogs. Casting this spell sparks a tempest of amphibians that fall in a 30’ diameter centered on the caster. All within that area must make a Ref and Fort save (DC 10+caster’s Int modifier). Failing the Reflex save indicates the character slips on a frog and falls prone; failing the Fort save means the character has been hit by large batrachians for 1d3 points of damage.",
  "89": "Phase out. After casting this spell, the wizard shifts out of phase with the world, making him invisible and invulnerable to attack but preventing him from interacting with his environment. This state lasts for 1d6 rounds +1 round per level of the spell.",
  "90": "Weatherman. Casting the spell upsets local weather patterns. Roll 1d7: (1) drought: no rain or moisture falls on the land for 1d12 years; (2) bitter winter sweeps over the land for 1d3 years; (3) incessant rain douses the land for 1d20 weeks; (4) a freak lightning storm hammers the area for 1d100 hours; (5) hurricane-like wind scours the earth for 1d7 weeks; (6) a localized eclipse blots out the sun for 1d20 days; (7) no stars are seen in the sky for 1d100 years. The area of effect is up to the judge’s determination.",
  "91": "Breath of life. Casting this spell imbues the caster and those around him with beneficial energies. All within 15’ of the caster (both friend and foe) are healed 1d6 points of damage for every level of the spell (i.e., a level 3 spell heals 3d6 damage).",
  "92": "Gibbering allies. Chittering, mephitic, rat-sized demons scurry forth from the wizard’s pockets and sleeves, scattering around him in a scratching fury. They attack enemies within 10’ (atk +2, 1d4 dmg) and aid the spell as appropriate before dissipating in a cloud of ash after 1 minute.",
  "93": "Greater power. The caster is allowed to roll twice for any random element of the spell (duration, damage, number affected, etc.) and take whichever result he wishes.",
  "94": "Fine control. The wizard is adept at reigning in the magical energies of the spell and can choose any result on the spell chart equal to or lower than the one rolled.",
  "95": "Psychic focus. Casting this spell clears the caster’s mind and prepares him to channel further energy. For 1d4 rounds after the spell is cast, the wizard receives a +4 bonus to other spell checks. This effect does not stack with itself.",
  "96": "Powerful caster. Instead of rolling as normal on a spell check, the wizard rolls a die improved by one step on the dice chain (e.g., d20 becomes d24).",
  "97": "Necrotic drain. The spell is powered by the energies of the living. The nearest creature (other than the caster) takes 1d6 hp of damage per spell level. For every 2 hp lost, the spell check result is increased by +1.",
  "98": "Natural-born talent. Instead of rolling as normal on a spell check, the wizard rolls a die type improved by two steps on the dice chain (e.g., if he normally rolls 1d20, he now rolls 1d30).",
  "99": "Roll again twice.",
  "100": "Roll again twice, but instead of rolling d%, roll 4d20 modified by the wizard’s Luck adjustment (in increments of 10%)."

                    "This lengthy ritual prepares the caster to bond with a familiar. The familiar makes itself known during the ceremony 50% of the time; otherwise, the caster makes its acquaintance sometime in the weeks following the ritual. The spell check is made upon completion of the ritual, and a minimum spellburn of 10 points is required to cast this spell. The caster gains hit points equal to the familiar’s and other powers as well, depending on the creature summoned. Once the caster has summoned a familiar (whether having met it or not), he cannot summon another until the current one dies and a full moon passes. If a familiar dies, the caster immediately keels over in intense pain, loses twice the familiar’s hit points permanently, and suffers a -5 spell check penalty until the next full moon. The judge will provide more information (see page 316)."

                        "The caster commits himself to the service of a supernatural lord, forming a pact to gain its support as his patron so long as he continues to please it with his service. This patron may be a demon, devil, ghost, spirit, elemental, angel, chaos lord, or other supernatural being who accepts the caster’s service. The initial ceremony takes one week to complete. Once the pact is made, the caster may invoke the patron’s support with the spell invoke patron, and it may or may not answer as it sees fit. In return for the patron’s assistance, it may ask the caster to do certain things. The caster must act faithfully in its service at all times, lest it cast him off. The caster may perform more than one ceremony to serve multiple masters, but doing so may raise questions as to his true loyalties. This is dangerous magic; a supernatural patron is not the same as the deity that a cleric may worship. The caster should be forewarned that he is in communion with almighty spirits. Alternately, once the caster has formed a bond with his patron, this spell may be cast to create a bond between another mortal and the caster’s patron. The mortal need not be a spellcaster; in fact, the second mortal usually is not. In this case, both the caster and the recipient must spend a week on the ceremony, which requires a mighty oath to declare allegiance to the patron. Very powerful creatures are more likely to successfully bond with patrons (who look more favorably upon powerful followers). Typically, a casting of patron bond on behalf of another receives a bonus of +2 if the subject is of 5th-level (5 HD) or higher and +4 if the subject is of 9th-level (9 HD) or higher. At the end of the ceremony, the casting of the spell seals the bond. Recruiting additional followers for his patron brings the caster favor and may grant boons to the other followers; though, their patron will ask fealty of them in exchange. Note that continued casting of this spell may taint the caster, both spiritually and physically."

There are different alphabets: dwarven runes, elder sigils, the hieroglyphs of the sphinxes, and the signs of individual mages. With this spell, the caster can create the simplest runes, those comprehensible to mortals. The caster’s alignment is imbued in the rune traced, and a being triggering the rune of an opposing alignment suffers more dire effects. The caster traces the sign using costly rare materials that must be purchased ahead of time for 50 gp per rune. The spell check is made, determining which energies are imbued into the rune; the caster can choose one rune at or below the result of the check, with the choice made when the rune is inscribed. The rune can be traced in any object: brooch, book, tombstone, archway, door, floor, tabletop, etc. Subtract -2 from the spell check to trace the rune in mid-air; -4 to trace the rune invisibly; or -8 to trace the rune permanently (does not vanish when triggered). The effect is triggered per the specific sign as described below: when touched, passed, gazed upon, etc. On a failed spell check, the sign fizzles and dissolves, and the materials use to make it are lost. On a success, the spell check becomes the DC for the opposing save. You can identify an unknown rune with a read magic spell or a successful runic alphabet spell check against the caster’s check result."

Detecting the answer to a specific question within the scope of the thoughts described below generally takes 1d4 rounds once the appropriate round of concentration is reached. For example, finding out where an evil necromancer hid his magic ring takes 1d4 rounds after the 4th round of concentration (recent memories), and understanding why the necromancer bears an irrational hatred toward the king takes 1d4 rounds after the 6th round of concentration (subconscious motivations).",

All other thoughts remain clouded and indistinct, much like a distant murmur. When the caster has designated a specific creature, it receives no save if it is 2 HD or less and a Will save if 3 HD or more, but it is not aware of the attempt to read its mind even if it makes the save (the judge should roll). The judge should roll the save for these targets. If the caster is successful, he detects surface-level thoughts: the creature’s emotional state, any actions it is intent upon, and so on.

If the caster stops concentrating, the spell continues until the end of the day, and he need only focus on another target to resume reading minds. For a period of one month, the caster can detect the thoughts of multiple creatures. For a period of one day, he gains awareness of the swirling morass of all thoughts within 100 miles of his position. Much like the background noise of a forest, the caster can “hear” all thoughts. By concentrating, the caster can narrow the focus onto one creature.

All other thoughts remain clouded and indistinct, much like a distant murmur, but the caster can choose to narrow the focus steadily. With a round of concentration, the caster can narrow the thoughts he hears to one category of creatures (for example, “all men” or “all warriors” or “all dwarves”). The caster can then continue to narrow the categories with subsequent rounds of concentration; each time he is aware of how many creatures remain part of the “murmur” and what general category of creature to which they belong. When there are only a dozen or so creatures left, the caster can sift through individuals, and choose to focus on one, even if it is unfamiliar to him. When the caster has designated a specific creature, it receives no save if it is 3 HD or less and a Will save if 4 HD or more, but it is not aware of the attempt to read its mind even if it makes the save (the judge should roll). The judge should roll the save for these targets. If the caster is successful, he detects surface-level thoughts: the creature’s emotional state, any actions it is intent upon, and so on. By continuing to concentrate, the caster can continue to read the surface thoughts of the target, as noted in the general spell description. If the caster stops concentrating, the spell continues until the end of the month duration, and he need only focus on another target to resume reading minds. If the caster chooses, he can “anchor” his thoughts to those of a single target. This requires seven sequential rounds of concentration, and the target receives a second Will save after the seventh round. It is aware of this attempt and perceives that someone is trying to read its thoughts. If the target fails the save and the caster successfully anchors his thoughts, he remains aware of that target’s ongoing thought processes at all times. The caster effectively maintains an ongoing link to read the target’s mind. This link lasts until the end of the spell’s duration. However, while anchored to one target in this manner, the spell blocks out other background thoughts and the caster cannot hear the “overall murmur” of other thoughts around him."

For example, the caster can change memories of what the king’s face looks like, or whether last summer was hot, or the number of cows in Old Man Hanson’s field. Additionally, the caster can pick out a total of 10 HD of people within the affected area to affect more substantially.

              "With this spell, the wizard crafts a staff and imbues it with magical energies linked to his soul. A wizard can create only one staff at a time and suffers great pains if it is destroyed. The material cost is 1,000 gp per caster level, plus any unusual materials (e.g., an adamantine staff requires sufficient adamantine), plus a minimum of 2 points of spellburn per caster level to properly bond the staff. One point of this spellburn never heals; it is permanent ability loss. Additionally, the caster must have the requisite spells that will be placed into the staff, and be able to utilize them without rest during the casting period. The casting period is ongoing with brief spurts of restless sleep, and the caster does not heal spellburn (or other wounds) during this time. The staff’s efficacy is much greater at higher caster levels, and thus the time and material cost rises as the wizard progresses in power level. In the descriptions below, “original caster level” refers to the level at which the wizard crafted the staff – if he advances in level after creating the staff, abilities associated with original caster level do not increase."

Then he repeats this process for the second and third spells. For each check that succeeds, he imbues the staff with 1 charge of the relevant spell. For example, the level 4 caster could put up to 12 charges in the staff if every check succeeded (3 spells x 4 castings per spell = 12 charges). Thenceforth, the caster may burn those charges to cast the three spells stored in the staff, making a normal spell check to cast the spell, modified by the +1 or +2 bonus associated with that spell. Once expended, the charges are lost unless renewed. Renewal requires a modified casting of this spell, with a casting time of 1 week and no materials or spellburn required; if this modified version succeeds at DC 30 or better, the caster can repeat the process above to restore the castings, but cannot exceed the original number of charges."

Renewal requires a modified casting of this spell, with a casting time of 1 week and no materials or spellburn required; if this modified version succeeds at DC 30 or better, the caster can repeat the process above to restore the castings, but cannot exceed the original number of charges. Finally, the caster may grant the staff one unique ability. For example, the ability to wither an opponent’s limbs or the power to transform into a serpent. These unique abilities require research, practice, and special materials. They should be determined with the aid of the judge."

This spell requires a minimum of 1 point of spellburn, and that spellburn will not heal until the eldritch hound returns from whence it came. It has no permanent form on the material plane and usually appears as a shadow or steaming mist. The caster must make known to the hound the object or person it seeks in clear and direct terms; ambiguity may result in the wrong target being sought. A physical sample, such as clothing, hair, or a vial of blood, is preferable; a painting, description, name (or true name) is of secondary value. The hound has an extraordinary sense of smell, as well as rudimentary ESP and second sight. Provided with sufficient foundational evidence and a trail to seek, it is usually very successful in finding its target. It will seek and return the specified person or object, dead or alive, to the place where it was first summoned. It has no preference between “dead” or “alive” and usually chooses the most expedient manner.",

It has AC 18, 4d12 hp, attacks at +8 (2d6 damage), and saves as the caster. It will not fight arbitrarily or even in the caster’s defense – it will only fight to retrieve the specified person or object, and only then if combat is completely unavoidable. It is patient and would prefer to wait than fight. Provided with sufficient information, there is a base chance the hound succeeds in finding the trail of its target (as noted in the spell checks below), though it cannot shift between planes (unless noted otherwise below), and success in locating the object does not always mean success in retrieving it within the indicated time.

The caster can control the vertical and horizontal shape of the wind gust and can send it snaking into the sky, around a corner, or down a pit. Creatures caught within the gust move along the designated vector. Those tossed into the air take normal falling damage when ejected (1d6 points per 10’ fallen). The gust has a range of 300’ and a final width of 100’. The caster can use this gust of wind to push objects toward him if he points the cone in such a direction. All creatures in the affected area must make a DC 28 Strength check or be forced back to the edge of the cone. Unattended objects of less than 200 pounds are also pushed back. If a target being pushed back impacts an obstruction before hitting the edge of the cone, it takes 1d14 damage and is pinned against the obstruction until it makes a DC 28 Strength check or the wind dies down. Closed flames, such as those in a lantern, are extinguished 90% of the time. Additionally, the gust of wind continues for up to 10 rounds for as long as the caster continues to concentrate.

The gust of wind travels up to 400’ in all directions and can vector in a manner designated. For example, the caster could send the wind up into the sky or push targets down into the ground. Creatures that are at a vertical height when the wind diminishes take normal falling damage (1d6 per 10’ fallen).

The object need not require physical passage, though; the caster could also designate a pedestal, throne, obelisk, tile, or river, or even a boat or wagon that when utilized acts as the portal. A corresponding object on “the other side” is also designated, though the portals need not be two-way. The caster must spend one week at each location as the casting time for this spell and utilize exotic planar materials costing 50,000 gp per “direction” in addition to the cost of the objects (i.e., a one-way portal costs 50,000 gp, while a two-way portal costs 100,000 gp). A minimum of 10 points of spellburn is required. The objects become permanently linked up to any physical distance and across any number of planes or dimensions.

By casting this spell, the caster can trace a fey rune. The materials necessary to inscribe the rune cost 200 gp per rune. The spell check is made to determine which energies the caster can imbue in his rune; the caster can choose one rune at or below the result of the check, with the choice made when the rune is inscribed. The rune can be traced in any object: on a leaf or tree bark, on a cloak or ring, over a door, under a tabletop, and so on. Subtract -2 from the spell check to trace in mid-air; -4 to trace invisibly; or -8 to trace permanently (does not vanish when triggered). The effect is triggered per the specific sign as described below: when touched, passed, gazed upon, etc. On a failed spell check, the sign fizzles and dissolves and materials are lost. On a success, the spell check becomes the DC for the opposing save. The caster can identify an unknown rune with a successful spell check against the opposing caster’s check result."

Spellburn utilized in the casting is lost for the duration of the casting and only heals when the spell is complete. All costs are expended before the spell check is made, and failure means all costs are lost; a weapon that is unsuccessfully enchanted can be re-forged to recover half the material costs involved.",
                "Generally speaking, follow this process to create a magic weapon:",
                "**Forge the weapon:** The weapon must be forged while this spell is cast. A dagger, short sword, long sword, or two-handed sword is easily enchanted. Using this spell to enchant other kinds of weapons entails a -1 penalty to the spell check, increased to -2 if the caster is not proficient with the weapon in question. Construction of the physical weapon itself costs a minimum of 100x the cost of a normal weapon of that type in raw materials of the highest quality, plus any wages paid to the blacksmith(s).",
                "**The basic enchantment:** The first spell check determines the basic enchantment. The caster’s level determines the maximum possible effectiveness of the weapon: CL5 = +1, CL6 = +2, CL7 = +3, CL8 = +4, CL10 = +5. Make a spell check and compare the result to Table 8-4 to determine the “plus” of the weapon. The cost of a plus, in addition to the weapon itself, is as follows, reflected in extraordinarily rare materials: +1 = 5,000 gp; +2 = 10,000 gp; +3 = 50,000 gp; +4 = 500,000 gp; +5 = 1,000,000 gp.",
                "**The weapon’s intelligence:** A magic weapon is always intelligent. Reference Table 8-4 to determine the dice rolled for the weapon’s Intelligence and how it communicates. The weapon has a personality that is a blend of the caster’s, the blacksmith involved, patrons invoked, and any other particulars of its creation (a dragon-bane weapon may behave arrogant like a dragon).",
                "**Alignment:** A magic weapon is usually, but not always, the same alignment as its creator. Reference Table 8-3 for the result of the spell check. Weapons of different alignments than their creators will not be easy to use.",
                "**Banes:** A magic weapon can be constructed for the purpose of slaying a particular kind of foe. Reference Table 8-4 to determine the number of potential banes at any given spell check result and Table 8-5 for the effects of various banes. Each bane built into a weapon costs from 20,000 to 100,000 gp and requires voluminous material samples of the creature type in question (for example, a dozen dragon corpses or 100 orcs). The cost depends on the level of effect and is at the discretion of the judge (i.e., the most deadly result of instant death costs the most, while the simplest result of a bonus to hit is the cheapest). The caster must declare what kind of banes he is trying to instill in his weapon. Depending on the spell check, he may be successful in none, some, or all of those. If a limited number is granted, the judge randomly determines which are successful.",
                "**Special purpose:** A magic weapon always has a special purpose, and it is not always under the control of the caster. The special purpose is determined by the most recondite of factors, ranging from astrological signs to natural terrain to the most subtle properties used in the crafting of the weapon. Table 8-4 indicates the dice rolled for a weapon’s special purpose, based on the spell check; those dice are then rolled on table 8-6. The result is always random, then the caster can utilize spellburn to shift the table’s results. For every point of spellburn, he can increase or decrease his roll by 1 point. This spellburn is determined after rolling for the special purpose. The level of spellburn employed determines the caster’s knowledge of the process and how carefully he can actually influence the result of his crafting. Under certain circumstances, particularly if a caster has a powerful patron, the judge may choose a special purpose that is aligned with the caster’s patron or some other greater power. There is no gp cost to a special purpose.",
                "**Powers:** Sword powers come in three varieties: type I, type II, and type III (see tables 8-7, 8-8, and 8-9). The special check determines which powers a sword may have. The caster pays a cost to imbue a sword with powers: 10,000 gp for each type I power, 20,000 gp for each type II power, and 50,000 for each type III power. Depending on the result of the spell check, the weapon will have some number of those powers evident at the completion of the casting. It is quite possible that the caster will spend the money to imbue the powers but his spell check will not be sufficient to complete them, or his spell check results in a percentile chance which does not yield those powers.",
                "**Creation properties:** Several of the entries above note specialized circumstances that can influence a sword’s final traits. These creation properties are sometimes known factors, and other times are incidental events that affect the creation process inadvertently. Here are some potential creation properties, which can be used by the player to attempt to influence the final weapon created and by the judge to introduce unusual purposes or powers beyond the intent of the creator. Creation properties: crafter (not necessarily caster) is an elf, dwarf, giant, god, demon, last of a line, a wronged king, or seventh son; weapon is crafted on the plane of fire (or in a volcano or lava lake), on the plane of water (or under the sea, deep in a lake, or on a sailing ship), on the plane of earth (or far below in the underdeep, or within a mine), on the plane of air (or on a cloud, or atop a mountain above the clouds), on the plane of a demon prince or one of the Nine Hells, in the lair of a great dragon, in a graveyard or ossuary, a lich’s crypt, a vampire’s coffin, or a mummy’s tomb, on a great battlefield, or in the fey lands; date of crafting is the birthday of a prince, the day a witch is hanged, or on the death of a god; moment of completion is at sunset, sunrise, high noon, during a full moon, during an eclipse; material components of sword include remnants of a pegasus, dragon, demon, un-dead, etc.; creator’s Luck is at a certain level; iron or wood from which sword is forged is from a specific place; creator’s spoken language includes a certain tongue; and so on."

Its wisdom is great and it knows much forgotten lore. The caster can ask a number of questions of Mycetes-Thrax equal to his CL, which it answers truthfully (if slowly). The judge will deem whether the Sleeping Growth knows the answers. Lastly, if the caster desires destruction, Mycetes-Thrax can ripple its great, slumbering corpus, causing destructive earthquakes, tsunamis, and avalanches in locations up to 300 miles away."

Unerring hunters can carry a single man-sized or smaller creature without difficulty. They suffer normal damage from weapons of a +1 enchantment or greater and half-damage from normal weapons. They can occlude their forms with shadows to hide themselves and gain a +10 bonus to avoid detection. They can see invisible creatures. Hunters track their victims through magic; mundane means by the prey to hide its trail are never successful. Hunters cannot cross magical barriers but will wait patiently for wards to expire or for prey to leave the protected area. Slaying a hunter causes the spell to end and a new hunter cannot be sent against the target until 1 month has passed."
